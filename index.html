                <p>Our IPot is the perfect addition to your home or office. It's a cheap, accessible way to keep your plants happy and healthy, even in the middle of winter. The Self Watering Pot has a built-in LED system that shows you the current soil nutrient level, so you can make sure your plants are getting all they need to grow strong. Our Smart Algorithm uses the temperature and humidity data from around your plant to automatically configure the pot to its needs.</p>
                <p>The IPot also has wireless capabilities—you can connect it to your smartphone or another device through Bluetooth or Wi-Fi and send notifications when there's water available. And if you want some extra music while you're watering? We've got that too! The speakers on our Self Watering Pot are designed just for that purpose—they're loud enough to fill a room but soft enough not to disturb anyone in the room next door who might be trying to sleep.</p>
